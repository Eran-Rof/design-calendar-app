# 13. Accounts Payable (M3)

The Accounts Payable module records vendor bills, drives them through approval + GL posting, captures payments, and surfaces the payment ledger for accountant review. AP is fully integrated with three P2 cross-cutters: **Approvals** (gate by amount or new-vendor flag), **Notifications** (events fan out to accountant + admin recipients), and **Documents** (attach the vendor's PDF + supporting receipts to each invoice).

Tangerine P3 Chunk 2 (PR #351) ships the admin UI + handlers on top of the P3 Chunk 1 schema (PR #349).

## Creating an AP invoice (draft)

From the **AP Invoices** panel, click **+ New invoice**.

| Field | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vendor | yes | Sourced from M35 Vendor Master (must already exist) |
| Invoice number | yes | The vendor's number; must be unique per (entity, vendor) |
| Kind | yes | `vendor_bill` / `vendor_credit_memo` / `expense_report` |
| Posting date | yes | The date the GL JE will land on (must be inside an open period at posting time) |
| Due date | optional | Defaults to posting date if blank — set explicitly per vendor terms |
| Payment terms | optional | **Auto-fills from the vendor master's `payment_terms_id`** when you pick a vendor. On a new invoice the vendor's preset is adopted; on an existing invoice it only fills if the field is still empty (an explicit edit is never clobbered). Pick from the M-Payment-Terms master or leave `(none)`. |
| Default expense account | optional | Used when a line has no per-line override (also auto-fills from the vendor master) |
| AP account | optional | Defaults to `entities.default_ap_account_id` (code `2010`) (also auto-fills from the vendor master) |
| Description | optional | Free text |
| Lines (≥ 1) | yes | Mix of expense lines and inventory lines |

### Line types

**Expense line:** `expense_account_id` + `amount_cents` (dollars in the UI, stored as cents).

**Inventory line:** `inventory_item_id` + `quantity` + `unit_cost_cents` (unit cost in dollars in the UI). At post time, inventory lines feed M5 FIFO layer creation (wired in P3-4 — until then they post against the default inventory GL account `1310`).

The trigger `invoice_line_items_total_trg` (from P3-1) recomputes `invoices.total_amount_cents` after every line insert / update / delete. The UI shows a running total under the lines table.

### ☰ List / ▦ Matrix view

The Lines section has a **☰ List / ▦ Matrix** toggle. **List** is the editable default (mix of expense + inventory lines). **Matrix** shows the **inventory** lines as a read-only **color × size grid** (rows = color, columns = size, with row/column totals) by resolving each inventory line's item id to its SKU's color/size — useful for checking the size breakdown of a goods bill against the PO. **Expense lines** (and any inventory item missing a color/size) can't go in the grid; they're listed under a **"Non-matrix lines"** section beneath the matrix.

## Posting — Approval gate

Click **Post** on a draft row. The handler:

1. Calls `approvalsAPI.requestIfRequired({ kind: 'ap_invoice', amount_cents: total, payload: { vendor_new } })`.
2. If a rule matches (e.g. amount > $5k, or new vendor):
   - Sets `gl_status='pending_approval'`.
   - Fires the `ap_invoice_approval_requested` notification to the **admin** role.
   - Returns `202 { requires_approval: true, approval_request_id }`.
   - The accountant + admin see the row in the **Approval Inbox** panel and decide.
3. If no rule matches: continues directly to step 4.
4. Calls `postEvent({ kind: 'ap_invoice_received' })` — the posting service produces the accrual JE (DR expense / inventory; CR AP control). No cash JE at receipt — cash basis recognizes the expense at payment time.
5. Sets `gl_status='posted'` and stamps `accrual_je_id`.
6. Fires the `ap_invoice_posted` notification to **accountant + admin**.

When the approver clicks **Approve** in the **Approval Inbox**, the M27 `decide` handler (P2 Chunk 2) re-runs the post path automatically via the side-effect hook in `approval-requests/decide.js`. The invoice flips from `pending_approval` to `posted` in one round trip.

## Recording a payment

Click **Pay** on a posted row. The Pay sub-modal collects:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Payment date | yes | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Amount $ | yes | Defaults to outstanding balance; partial pays are OK |
| Method | yes | `ach` / `wire` / `check` / `credit_card` / `cash` |
| Bank account | optional | Defaults to `entities.default_bank_account_id` (code `1010`) |
| Reference | optional | Check number, wire confirm, card auth |
| Notes | optional | Free text |

The handler:

1. Inserts a row in `invoice_payments`. The DB overpay trigger (`invoice_payments_overpay_guard_trg` from P3-1) blocks `paid + new > total` with a check-violation → 409 surfaces as "Overpayment rejected".
2. Calls `postEvent({ kind: 'ap_invoice_paid' })` — posts the accrual JE (DR AP / CR Bank) **and** the sibling cash JE (DR Expense / CR Bank) linked via `gl_link_sibling_je`.
3. Stamps `invoice_payments.cash_je_id`. If this payment fully covers the invoice, flips `invoices.gl_status='paid'`.
4. Fires the `ap_invoice_paid` notification.

After payment, the payment row is visible in the **AP Payments** ledger.

## Voiding

Click **Void** on any non-void row. The handler:

1. Calls `postEvent({ kind: 'ap_invoice_voided' })`. The `apInvoiceVoided` rule (from P3-1) returns either an empty reversal list (for never-posted invoices) or `[accrual_je_id, cash_je_id?]` for posted/paid invoices.
2. Reverses each JE via `reverseJournalEntry` (creates a new reversing JE; flips the original to `status='reversed'`).
3. Flips `invoices.gl_status='void'` regardless.
4. Fires the `ap_invoice_voided` notification.

Voids are non-destructive — the original JEs stay in the GL with `status='reversed'`, and the reversing JEs net them to zero. The invoice row is preserved (you can re-open the modal in read-only mode to see lines + linked JEs).

> **Frozen Save/Close footer.** The AP Invoice edit modal keeps its **Save / Close** (and **Record payment**) buttons pinned to the bottom as the modal scrolls, so they stay reachable on tall invoices with many lines + attachments. Same behaviour across the AR Receipts, Journal Entry, Receiving, QC Inspection, Cycle Count and Customs Entry modals.

## Document attachments

Inside the AP Invoice edit modal, the **Supporting documents** section embeds `<DocumentAttachmentList>` (M29) scoped to `contextTable='invoices'` and the invoice's id. Supported kinds:

- `vendor_invoice_pdf` — the vendor's actual bill
- `receipt`           — receipts for expense lines
- `approval_correspondence` — emails about the approval decision
- `other`             — anything else

Files upload to the `tangerine-documents` Supabase storage bucket. Signed URLs are 5-minute expiring; never linkable directly.

## API surface (for integrations)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET  | `/api/internal/ap-invoices` | List with filters: `?status=`, `?vendor_id=`, `?from=`, `?to=`, `?q=`, `?include_void=` |
| POST | `/api/internal/ap-invoices` | Create a draft |
| GET  | `/api/internal/ap-invoices/:id` | Single + lines |
| PATCH | `/api/internal/ap-invoices/:id` | Edit (draft / unposted only) |
| DELETE | `/api/internal/ap-invoices/:id` | Delete (draft / unposted only) |
| POST | `/api/internal/ap-invoices/:id/post` | Promote to posted (or pending_approval) |
| POST | `/api/internal/ap-invoices/:id/pay` | Record a payment |
| POST | `/api/internal/ap-invoices/:id/void` | Void + reverse JEs |
| GET  | `/api/internal/ap-payments` | Read-only ledger |
| POST | `/api/ap/sync-bills` | Bulk ingest of real Xoro vendor bills (CSV) — see below |

Money is in BigInt cents on the wire. The UI converts dollars ↔ cents at the form boundary.

## Xoro real-bill feed (`source='xoro_ap'`)

While Xoro remains the system of record (pre-Tangerine go-live), the actual posted vendor bills flow in automatically from Xoro's `bill/getbill` endpoint. The nightly `rof_xoro_project/scripts/rest_ap_sync.py` downloads the bills and POSTs the gzipped `BillDetail*.csv` to **`POST /api/ap/sync-bills`** (multipart field `bills`, `design-calendar-api` Bearer token — same upload shape as `/api/master/sync`). Each bill lands as one `invoices` row (`source='xoro_ap'`, `invoice_kind='vendor_bill'`) plus its `invoice_line_items`.

**Supersede rule.** These real bills are authoritative. On a `(vendor_id, invoice_number)` collision:

| Existing `source` | Action |
|---|---|
| `manual` (or any non-xoro source) | **Skipped** — an operator-typed bill is never overwritten |
| `xoro_mirror` (T10 PO-derived synthetic) | **Updated in place** — the real bill supersedes the mirror-derived one |
| `xoro_ap` | **Updated in place** — idempotent re-sync |

Vendors are matched by **Vendor Name** against `vendors.code` / `vendors.aliases` (the CSV "Vendor Code" is the Xoro internal id and does not map); unmatched vendors are skipped and returned in the response so the operator can add a vendor or alias. At Tangerine go-live, native AP entry takes over and this feed is retired.

### Per-bill GL posting (2026-07-08)

Every synced Xoro bill now posts its own journal entry — this replaced the old daily AP summary, which had **never successfully posted** (it credited the AP control account without a vendor subledger, so the posting guard rejected it every night; found and confirmed during the July 8 re-rate). The per-bill JE:

- **DR 1201 Inventory** for item-linked lines (purchases build inventory; the per-invoice sales history posts the COGS that relieves it),
- **DR 8007 Uncategorized Expense** for non-item lines plus the tax/rounding remainder (re-route from the JE as needed — nothing silently disappears). If the vendor has a **default expense account** set (Vendor Master → `default_gl_expense_account_id`), that account is used for this line instead of 8007 (the account must exist, be postable, active, and non-control — otherwise the sweep falls back to 8007),
- **CR 2000 Accounts Payable** for the bill total, **subledgered to the vendor** — so the AP control account ties out to the bill ledger by construction. Credit memos post with the directions flipped.

The sweep runs automatically at the end of every `POST /api/ap/sync-bills` ingest and can be run by hand via **`POST /api/internal/ap-backfill/run`** `{ dry_run?: true, limit? }` (internal token; idempotent — only `gl_status='unposted'` bills are touched, and a duplicate post heals the bill row instead of erroring). Posted bills get `gl_status='posted'` + `accrual_je_id`, which lights up the status badge → JE drill in the AP Invoices panel. `journal_type='ap_invoice_historical'` rides the period-lock bypass so older bills backfill cleanly. **Not yet covered:** payment-side JEs (the CSV carries only a paid/unpaid status, no payment dates or amounts) — cash application for Xoro bills is a follow-up alongside the bank-feed work.

### 8007 Uncategorized Expense cleanup — vendor default expense accounts (2026-07-10)

Historically ~$8.88M of non-item bill charges landed in **8007 Uncategorized Expense** (the fallback above), so the P&L showed one lump instead of real expense categories. The cleanup has two halves:

1. **Go-forward** (already live since #1666): set the vendor's **Default expense account** in Vendor Master (Edit → "Default expense account", shown as "code — name"). Every future bill's non-item/tax slice posts there instead of 8007.
2. **History**: `node scripts/reclass-8007.mjs` reclasses what already sits in 8007, one JE per **(vendor, month)** — `DR` the vendor's default expense account / `CR 8007` for that month's 8007 activity, **dated to the source month** (month-end; the in-flight current month uses its latest source-line date). Phases: `report` (read-only shape + writes the review CSV), `set-defaults` (applies the HIGH-confidence name→account mapping, never overwriting an operator-set default), `reclass`, `verify`. All phases support `--dry-run`.

Posting hygiene: `journal_type='vendor_expense_reclass'` (or `'vendor_inventory_reclass'` for CEO-confirmed inventory vendors — see below), `source_module='ap'`, `source_table='vendor_expense_reclass'`, `source_id='<vendor_id>:<YYYY-MM>'` (the source-key unique index makes re-runs idempotent), audit reason on every JE. **The reclass never touches AP 2000** — `verify` counts reclass lines on 2000 and requires zero.

**What was moved:**

- **First run (2026-07-10, #1675):** 523 JEs, **$5,224,663.22** into 39 real expense accounts across 70 vendors. 8007 $8,875,418.82 → $3,650,755.60.
- **Rosenthal decision (2026-07-10, #1679):** CEO ruled the controller-reconciled Xoro AP bills are the factoring-cost source of truth; the 12 statement-derived #1670 `factor_cost` JEs ($515,690.72) were deleted, Rosenthal's default was set to **6802 Factor Commissions**, and its **$859,158.88** swept out of 8007 (21 JEs). The script's Rosenthal exclusion is lifted.
- **CEO-authorized auto-set expansion + Factory 1 inventory (2026-07-10):** 145 more vendor defaults set from name classification ("auto set the vendor expense accounts for the vendors you have bills for"), and **Factory 1 confirmed as inventory** — its **$623,414.04** reclassed **DR 1201 Inventory / CR 8007** (17 monthly JEs, `journal_type='vendor_inventory_reclass'`; rationale: those goods' sales already relieved 1201 via the AR COGS legs at average cost, so the missing purchase-side DR understated inventory). This run: 576 new JEs, **$1,401,163.16**. **8007 now $1,390,433.56.** Verified: trial-balance imbalance $0.00, 1,120/1,120 reclass JEs balanced, 0 reclass lines on 2000.

- **Vendor deposits (2026-07-10):** the CEO flagged that some confirm-list entries "look like prepayments prior to receiving the invoice." Register evidence was probed for every suspect (round amounts, cash-paid-in-full, vendor bill ref = the payment date, no absorbing invoice, and the register's `prepayments`/`credits` relief columns). Findings and treatment:
  - **OPEN deposits → 1308 Vendor Prepayments & Deposits (asset).** United Aryan $80,000.00 (paid 2025-12-05) and The Luxury Collection $25,000.00 (paid 2026-02-25) reclassed **DR 1308 / CR 8007** (`journal_type='vendor_prepayment_reclass'`, `PREPAYMENT_OPEN` script tier). They sit in 1308 until the merchandise invoice arrives and the controller applies them — worklist in **`docs/tangerine/ap-vendor-deposits.csv`**. (No new COA account needed: 1308 already exists from #1668, postable + non-control.)
  - **APPLIED deposits — no double-count, nothing to fix.** CNX America's two big bills are the GOODS invoices, not deposits: B005513 $209,690.17 absorbed a $25,000 deposit and B005662 $136,913.72 was fully deposit-settled — and the #1668 relief JEs already **CR'd 1308** for exactly those applications ($25,000 + $136,913.72 verified on prod), so the invoice's 8007 DR carries the goods cost exactly once. The deposit wires themselves live in 1308's pre-existing clearing balance, not in AP.
  - **NET-ZERO rows (not posted):** Dynamic Full $40,000.00, Anhui Taihe $14,012.64, NEXT ELEVATION $79,083.30 (2 of its 3 bills), Mass Apparel $0.70 were fully settled by vendor credits/discounts — their 8007 DR is exactly offset by the same bill's relief CR to 5005, so net P&L is already zero. Whether the "credit" was a true credit (no cost) or a deposit application Xoro recorded as a credit (cost real) is a controller call — flagged in the review CSV, never auto-posted.
  - **Go-forward:** deposit-looking bills in the nightly feed carry no reliable marker (no description, ref = date is a weak signal), so deposit routing to 1308 stays a **manual** step — do NOT set a goods vendor's default to 1308, or its real invoices would auto-route to the asset account.

**What remains in 8007 — $1,285,433.56** (see `docs/tangerine/ap-8007-review.csv` — vendor, monthly totals, suggested account, reason):

- **INVENTORY? $731,701.24 (8 vendors)** — goods-supplier vendors awaiting the CEO's confirm list, now with per-bill register evidence in the CSV (CNX America $355k, Interland $223k, NEXT ELEVATION $103k — $79k of which is net-zero, 2253 Apparel $43k, + tail). Once confirmed, add the name to `INVENTORY_CONFIRMED` in the script and re-run `reclass` — they post DR 1201 like Factory 1. **Never auto-posted without confirmation.**
- **FLAG $496,050.43 (11 vendors)** — related-party / financing rows that may be distributions or loan principal, not P&L: Venbrook $243k (broker — policy split needed), Bitton & Associates $80k, Isaac Bitton $60k, SBA $51k (principal vs 6342 interest), FTB $40k (CPA call), Tao Rodriguez/Maria Villarreal $7k, Valley Bank $4.6k, three life-insurance carriers $10.8k (possible officer life).
- **NET-ZERO $54,013.34 (3 vendors)** — credit/discount-settled bills whose P&L effect already nets to zero against 5005 (see above).
- **LOW $3,668.55 (9 vendors)** — genuinely zero-signal names (IDC, RMS, Daughter Santiago, …).

To finish the cleanup: for expense vendors, set the default in Vendor Master and re-run `node scripts/reclass-8007.mjs reclass` (it picks up **any** vendor with a validated default and posts only the missing (vendor, month) JEs); for inventory vendors, get CEO confirmation and extend `INVENTORY_CONFIRMED`; for deposit applications and the net-zero rows, controller works `ap-vendor-deposits.csv` and the CSV flags.

## Historical bill backfill (`source='xoro_bills_register'`, #1668)

The complete Xoro AP history — **3,680 bills (Oct 2023 → Jul 2026, $51,080,712.61)** from the CEO's Bills register export plus **2,685 bill payments ($41,126,644.78)** from the Payments export — is posted to the GL and frozen as the AP opening history. AP control account **2000 ties to the register to the cent**: GL 2000 = **$9,947,831.51 CR** = the register's Σ Amount Due over Open/Partially-Paid bills.

**Pipeline** (all idempotent — every JE carries a stable `(source_table, source_id, basis)` key):

1. `node scripts/import-bills-register.mjs <register.csv> [--create-vendors]` — parses the export (BOM, `"$ 1,234.19"` money, `-`-as-empty, MM/DD/YYYY) into staging table `ap_bill_register_import`, verifying the register identity on every row: `Total = Paid + Discounts + Credits + Due` (and `Credits = Vendor Credits + Prepayments`). Vendors resolve by payments-staging name → `vendors.name` → `vendors.aliases` (all case-insensitive).
2. `node scripts/post-bills-register.mjs <phase>` with phases `reconcile → link-invoices → accruals → deltas → relief → payments → residuals → verify` (each supports `--dry-run` / `--limit=N`).

**Accounting model:**

| JE | Lines | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Accrual (`ap_invoice_historical`, one per bill) | DR **1201 Inventory** (Vendor Type Suppliers/Manufacturer) or the vendor's default expense account, else **8007** · CR **2000** vendor-subledgered @ Total Amount | Bill Date |
| Relief (`ap_relief_historical`, bills with discounts/credits) | DR **2000** (vendor) · CR **5005 Vendor Discount** (discounts + vendor credits) · CR **1308 Vendor Prepayments & Deposits** (prepayments applied) | bill Modified date (application-date proxy) |
| Payment (`ap_payment_historical`, one per payment doc) | DR **2000** (vendor) · CR the mapped payment account @ **Paid Amount** (cash only) | Payment date |
| Residual / true-ups (`ap_adjustment_historical`) | DR/CR **2000** (vendor) vs **8002** / DR-account | export date / bill date |

**Key decisions (and why):**

- **Cutover 2024-08-31, no opening JE**: no opening-balance JE exists for 2000 and no GL periods exist before 2024-08 (entity hard-lock 2024-07-31), so the **58 bills dated before 2024-08-31 post AT 2024-08-31**; all were fully paid, and their payments ARE in the payments export, so they accrue + relieve normally rather than being skipped. The 108 bills dated exactly 08/31/2024 (dsantiago's Feb-2025 opening-AP backfills) accrue normally — they ARE the opening AP.
- **Payments are cash-only**: the two exports prove Σ(payment `Amount` − `Paid Amount`) = Σ(bills discounts + credits + prepayments applied) **to the cent ($6,229,033.16)** — a payment doc's non-cash slice is exactly the discount/credit/prepayment application. Those post at **bill** level (the register carries the precise 5005-vs-1308 split), and the **133 zero-cash payment docs get no JE**. Crediting banks at full `Amount` would have overstated cash out by $6.23M.
- **1308 Vendor Prepayments & Deposits** (new account, child of 1300 Deposits & Prepaid) carries a **CR $5,062,725.55 clearing balance**: prepayments applied to bills whose original deposit wires predate the GL's bank-cash history. When bank history is backfilled, deposit wires book DR 1308 and the account clears.
- **Xoro→Valley account mapping**: "Bank Leumi" payment accounts map to Valley 1001/1002/1003 (Leumi has no GL accounts of its own); other payment accounts map to 1020 Cash Clearing, 1051 Factor Advances, 2101–2108 credit cards, 3004 Opening Balance Equity — mapping fixed in `ap_payment_import.gl_account_id`.
- **Dedupe vs #1662**: 145 bills already carried per-bill accrual JEs from the Xoro API pull — skipped (`skip_reason='already_posted_1662'`). 24 of them were posted at the API line-sum, not the register header total — trued-up by delta JEs (net −$57,445.72) and the invoice totals aligned, so GL = subledger = register.
- **Frozen from the nightly sync**: register bills land in `invoices` with `source='xoro_bills_register'`, which `sync-bills` treats as foreign and never updates — the AP subledger stays exactly what the register said on 2026-07-08, which is what the GL ties to. Post-export Xoro activity (new bills, new payments) is NOT reflected until a re-export or cutover; new bills syncing in as `xoro_ap` still accrue via the #1662 sweep, but Xoro marking bills paid without Tangerine payment JEs will surface as tie-out drift — re-run this backfill from fresh exports at cutover (~2026-07-28).
- **Porsche residual $6,236.32**: the register says $6,236.32 more was paid on Porsche bills than the payments export applied (payments outside the export) — one per-vendor adjustment JE (DR 2000 / CR 8002 Reconciliation Discrepancies).
- **Control alignment**: a hanging DR $500 from a dry-run-test reversal pair (original excluded as `status='reversed'` while its reversal stayed posted) was neutralized by restoring the original to `posted`; $2,172.00 of `manufacture_service` credits sitting on 2000 with **no vendor bill** — dual-basis siblings, $1,086.00 ACCRUAL + $1,086.00 CASH — were reclassed to 2160 Accrued CMT / Conversion Clearing per basis (2000 is reserved for the vendor-bill subledger the daily tie-out proves; CASH-basis 2000 correctly ends at $0.00).

**Result**: 3,534 accrual JEs + 24 true-ups + 257 relief JEs + 2,552 payment JEs + 1 residual + 3 alignment JEs; the #1665 daily tie-out's AP `pending_payments` waiver lifts (payments now exist) and AP 2000 reports **ok** — GL $9,947,831.51 CR vs subledger $9,947,831.51, diff $0.00, and every top-10 vendor subledger balance matches the register exactly.

## Sub-decisions defaults (P3-1 → P3-2)

Per arch §11:

| Default | Code | Where stored |
|---|---|---|
| AP control account | `2010` | `entities.default_ap_account_id` (auto-seeded if `gl_accounts.code='2010'` exists) |
| Bank account | `1010` | `entities.default_bank_account_id` (auto-seeded if `gl_accounts.code='1010'` exists) |
| Inventory GL (for inventory lines at post time) | `1310` | Looked up by code at post time |
| Fallback expense account (cash-basis JE) | `6000` | Looked up by code at pay time when invoice/line has no expense_account_id |

If any of these GL accounts don't exist yet, the relevant handler returns a 400 with a clear message ("seed gl_accounts.code='1310'") so the accountant can create the row in the COA panel first.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Cannot edit invoice in gl_status='posted'` | PATCH attempted on a non-draft invoice | Use Void or post a credit-memo |
| `Cannot delete invoice in gl_status='posted'` | DELETE only allowed on draft | Use Void |
| `Overpayment rejected: paid X + new Y > total Z` | Pay would exceed total | Reduce amount or check existing payments |
| `Approvals gate failed: missing_kind` | requestIfRequired called with bad ctx | Bug — file an issue |
| `AP account is not configured` | No `ap_account_id` on invoice and no `default_ap_account_id` on entity | Set on invoice or seed entity default + `gl_accounts.code='2010'` |
| `Inventory has lines but no inventory GL account is configured` | Inventory line at post time and no `gl_accounts.code='1310'` | Create the inventory account in COA panel |

## Notifications fired

| Kind | When | Recipients (roles) |
|---|---|---|
| `ap_invoice_approval_requested` | Approval rule matches at Post | admin |
| `ap_invoice_posted` | After successful GL post | accountant, admin |
| `ap_invoice_paid` | After payment row + JE post | accountant, admin |
| `ap_invoice_voided` | After void completes | accountant, admin |

Recipients can opt out per (kind, channel) via the **Notification preferences** panel.
